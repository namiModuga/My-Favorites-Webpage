    <p class="center">
      This is a website on 3 of my favourite things. (Obviously I have more
      favourite things than these 3.)
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">Soccer</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="center">
      I love playing sports but my favourite sport out of all of them is soccer
      (I personally think it should be called football because thats the
      original name it had when it was created). The intensity, skill, and
      coordination needed with other people are all things that make this game
      extremely fun. Along with being in love with the sport, I also love
      watching it too.

    <h2 class="center">Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="center">
      Since I love watching soccer I have a favourite soccer player. This player
      is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is one of the best players in the world and to
      ever exist. He is also my idol since he had a very hard life when he was
      younger but still rose to become one of the best.

    <h2 class="center">Minecraft</h2>
    <hr />
    <p class="center">
      Along with sports I also like playing video games, my favourite video game
      being Minecraft. The endless possibilities of things that you can do along
      with the different ways you can do things makes it a very fun game. My
      favourite part is the multiplayer function where you can play with other
      friends in the same world which enhances the fun experience.
